Inventory App Project
======================

The application helps a small business to log and track inventory. Essentially, the application is managed in two screens. The splash screen or in this case, the catalog screen, lists all inventory along with related product details. Instant sale can be made from this screen by clicking on the "sell" button on the right hand side of the screen.

All details requested in the editor screen is mandatory to successfully add the product to the database. Failing to do so does not log the product and consequently cannot be tracked with this application. More of the same existing product can be added by going into the editor screen and clicking on the "order more" button. For existing products, along with the product information additional options and "order more" feature is also displayed. By clicking on the "order more" opens up the default email client with a pre-filled (addresses and subject) new email template.

Objective
-----------

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of 
products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It 
will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed 
supplier.
